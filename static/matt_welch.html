<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi there, my name is Matthew Welch, but I usually just go by "Matt." I currently work as a landscaping subcontractor in the city. Whether it's planting shrubs, designing flower beds, installing outdoor lighting, trimming bushes, or just cutting grass, I've done it. My hobbies include gardening, model railroading, and occasional video gaming, but of particular interest to me lately has been my Catholic faith. I'm heavily involved with a young adult group that meets at a Byzantine Catholic church in Homer Glen, and I regularly attend a traditional Latin Mass at my local parish. I started pursuing a degree in computer science back in 2014 but got sidetracked by a major chronic illness in the winter of 2017. It's taken years to recover and finally get back to a stable life, but I'm now finally wrapping up my education with the goal of becoming a software developer upon graduation.</p>

<h3>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>Software-as-a-Service development methodologies</li>
  <li>Additional JavaScript web app development tools</li>
  <li>How to create SQL database driven web applications</li>
</ul>

<h3>My Favorite Hobby</h3>
<p>I have different hobbies for different seasons, and the one that dominates for me during the summer is gardening. Over the past three years I've completely transformed the landscaping around my home. Where there used to be dull evergreens and gangly bushes now sits a variety of flowering trees, shrubs, and perrenials. I've taken the time to research which varieties of plants bloom the longest and most prolifically, and the payoff has been incredible! The compliments from the neighbors don't stop coming!</p>

<h3>Fun Fact</h3>
<p>I am related by blood to the Venerable Fr. Samuel Mazzuchelli O.P, a Dominican friar and missionary priest with a cause for sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
